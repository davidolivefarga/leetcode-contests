# üèÜ Leetcode contests üèÜ

Solutions for the [Leetcode Contest](https://leetcode.com/contest/) problems, written in Javascript.

Due to my timezone, the only contests I can attend live are Biweekly ones. However, I also plan to do all Weekly contests too, just to practice and learn. Sometimes I don't know to answer to a problem, or I can't find the most efficient one. If that's the case, I look at the answer and then I code it myself, to make sure I got the idea. In those cases, I'll give credit to the author of the answer.

If you want, you can check out [my Leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/davidolive/).

Thanks [Leetcode](https://twitter.com/leetcode) for organising these contests!

## Project structure

Every contest has its own folder, and inside there's a README file with the solutions to the contest problems.

Here's the list of all contests I did so far (or, to be more precise, those that I posted in GitHub):
